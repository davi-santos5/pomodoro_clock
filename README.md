# Pomodoro Clock

Chronometer build with ReactJS based on the Pomodoro Technique.

This chronometer helps to focus on tasks by using the Pomodoro Technique.
It works with two timers: Session Time and Break Time. In the session time you focus only on your task, in the break time you do something not work-related (take a break).<br>
Then you go back to work for another session time. And so on...

You can set both the session time and the break time. At anytime you can play/pause or reset the clock.<br>
When the clock's coutndown reaches zero an audio alert is played and the clock toggle between the two timers.



Project devolped based on this [freeCodeCamp Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock)
